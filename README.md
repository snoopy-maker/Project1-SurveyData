## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

The list of required libraries as below:

* numpy
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib

## Project Motivation
The survey comprises of close to 85 questions have collected nearly 90,000 responses from developers around the world. It covers some interesting questions that can be used for our analysis to better understand

1. Did work culture around the world changed before and after global pandemic?
2. Which are the top 10 countries adopted remote work culture or reverse to work onsite culture after global pandemic?
3. Does global demand of developers after pandemic boost the recruitment and salary for developers?

## File Descriptions 
There is 1 notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@swetling.chan/how-global-pandemic-changed-developers-work-culture-and-salary-3e9d93459db2).
